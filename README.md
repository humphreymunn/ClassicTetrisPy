# ClassicTetrisPy
Written by Humphrey Munn (2019)
Inspired by the original tetris game
This game replicates tetris but with some unique changes with both gameplay and layout, as I wanted to 
create something new from such a legendary game.
These will be apparent when playing the game.
Tkinter is not the best game engine lol (maybe should have used pygame, however I wanted to test
my ability with collisions and writting the game completely from scratch.)
Any feedback or other enquiries email h.munn88@gmail.com.
